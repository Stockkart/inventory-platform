# @inventory-platform/product

**Status:** Migrated

Inventory and sell flows: product registration, search, stock corrections, scan-sell / checkout, returns, and purchase history.

## Owns

- Routes: `product-registration`, `import`, `product-search`, `stock-corrections`, `vendor-invoices`, `scan-sell`, `checkout`, `history`, `refund`, `vendor-return`, `m/upload`
- Nav groups **Products & Sales**, **Returns**, History under reports
- Product/inventory APIs + Query hooks
- Scan Sell UI and related widgets (`ui/`, `vertical/`)

## Does not own

- Cafe menu / ingredient manual stock (`plugins/cafe`)
- Pricing edit screens (`core/pricing`) — product may link into them
- Checkout domain package (`core/checkout` is still a scaffold; checkout route lives here today)

## Layout

`api/` · `queries/` · `pages/` · `ui/` · `vertical/` · `routes.ts` · `nav.ts`

## UI chrome

Prefer `productChrome` / `registrationChrome` from ui-kit for Scan Sell, carts, and registration grids.
